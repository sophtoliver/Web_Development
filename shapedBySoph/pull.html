                    <p class="pull-p">Pulling is vital for everyday functional movement. 
                        It is needed for pulling doors, lifting grocery bags, etc. 
                        A pull day means dedicating a day to working a group of muscles in the upper part of the body. 
                        A majority of the muscles are found in the back region. It helps to 
                        alternate between a pull day and a push day as it creates muscle balance and 
                        allows one muscle group to recover while working on the other group. Pull day 
                        workouts should consist of horizontal pulls, vertical pulls, lateral raises, 
                        upright raises, retraction of the scapular and biceps exercises.

                    <p class="pull-p">Pull day muscles primarily engage muscles of the upper body involved in pulling motion. 
                        These muscles are also important for mobility and posture. The muscles include:

                        With the barbell, you can knock out a series of blasting exercises for your back, upper body, and cores. 
                        The following barbell moves are some examples to help you achieve that:

                                which puts the biceps in more of a stretched position. Exercises that generate 
                                high tension at long muscle lengths are important to include in your training program, 
                                as they stimulate stretch-mediated hypertrophy.

                                the chin-up will get more activation in the traps and

                                It also engages the lats, i.e., the latissimus dorsi (the widest muscle in the human body 
                                that covers almost all the back).

                                including the upper-mid portion of your back, the latissimus dorsi 
                                and the secondary muscles in between: face pulls, cable reverse fly, seated cable row,
