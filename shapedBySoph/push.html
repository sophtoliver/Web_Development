                <h1 id="push-r2">What is a Push Day?</h1>
                <p id="push-r3">As the name suggests, a push day workout consists of upper body exercises
                    that utilize a pushing motion. These exercises primarily target the chest, shoulders, and triceps.
                    On the other hand, pull exercises engage the back, rear delts, and biceps. 
                </p>
                <h1 id="push-r4">What are the Benefits of Push Day Workouts?</h1>
                <p id="push-r5">Performing a broad range of push exercises helps maintain a strong and
                    healthy body, not just for your muscles, but your bones and joints as well. Dedicating 
                    specific days to push day workouts allows you to work harder and maximize rest. 
                    The idea behind seperating push and pull days is to work specific related muscle groups together 
                    and to exhaust those muscles. This way you will not be training the same muscle groups two days in a row,
                    which can help optimze recovery time.
