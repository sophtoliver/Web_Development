                        My fitness journey started in high school while I was working two jobs and going to school full time.
                        Overwhelmed with post-graduation plans and the challenges of being a growing young adult, I used fitness as an outlet for 
                        relieving stress. Not having a gym partner or friends who took fitness seriously, I yearned for motivation to encourage myself
                        to keep trying. I created this platform to bring together a community of supportive, like-minded individuals so 
                        that woman getting into the gym have a way to escape that feeling I felt so many years ago. Fitness comes in all shapes and sizes
                        and can be illustrated in any and all places. <br> <br> My goal is to inspire everyone to get in that mentality that YOU CAN DO IT. I am here to 
                        provide all the resources you need to become the best version of yourself.
