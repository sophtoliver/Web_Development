                <h1>Hamstring Anatomy</h1>
                <p>The hamstrings are a rare and unique lower-body muscle group that actually acts at two joints. 
                    Flexing your hamstrings will bend your knee, much as you do during leg curls. 
                    Your hamstrings also act on your hip joint too, driving your hips into “extension,” 
                    essentially pushing your hips forward directly under your spine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both motions are key to your general movement, and they’re even more important for athleticism. 
                    Powerful hip extension, in fact, is widely acknowledged as a key trait for sprinting, jumping, bounding, and lunging.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your hamstrings actually consist of three main muscles: the semimembranosus, the semitendinosus, 
                    and the biceps femoris. The biceps femoris includes two separate heads, a long head and a short head.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both semis and the long head of the biceps femoris originate at the ischial tuberosity in the pelvis. This means they are involved in hip extension. 
                    Hip extension is what happens when you stand up straight, and your thigh and torso straighten out. 
                    (The short head of the biceps femoris originates at the shaft of the femur, or thigh bone.) Hip extension moves like glute bridges, 
                    and even the final act of standing up fully straight and pushing your pelvis forward during a squat, will recruit a lot of hamstring muscle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Meanwhile, all your hamstring muscles are active during knee flexion, the bending of your knee. Semimembranosus and semitendinosus insert at the tibia, 
                    while the biceps femoris insert at the head of the fibula. That placement means your lower leg internally rotates because of the semis, 
                    while it externally rotates because of the biceps femoris. This means you can create focus on different muscles by thinking about tibial rotation.
                </p>

                    <h3>Romanian Deadlift</h3>
                    <p>Romanian Deadlift is a great hip-hinging pattern that involves the hip extension of the deadlift 
                        while eliminating any extra knee action or focus. You maintain a soft bend in the knee, 
                        which places the emphasis of the move entirely on your posterior chain.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Single-Leg Deadlift</h3>
                    <p>
                        The single-leg deadlift has all the advantages of the Romanian deadlift, 
                        except it recruits more posterior chain muscles to maintain stability. 
                        The gluteus medius jumps into the action to stabilize your femur at the 
                        hip joint while you focus your body to remain parallel to the ground.

                    <h3>Hex-Bar Deadlift</h3>
                    <p>
                        The most translatable lower body move to everyday life that we have. 
                        The hex bar relieves the stress on the upper body by placing the hands 
                        in a neutral grip by your sides. This allows you to pack on more weight on, 
                        challenging your legs that much more.
