                <h1 id="quad-header">The 7 Best Quad Exercises</h1>
                <p>Here are the best quadriceps exercises to annihilate your legs:</p>
                <div class="quad-exercise-1">
                    <h3>Barbell Squat: Front and Back</h3>
                    <p>
                        Without squats, you aren’t working your legs. There are dozens of squat variations, 
                        but the traditional front and back barbell squats are, frankly, all you need. 
                        The barbell squat is a whole-body exercise that targets every major muscle group 
                        minus the chest. The issue is that most people squat incorrectly, reducing the 
                        effectiveness of the exercise.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
                    <ul class="quad-list">
                        <li>When starting, stand with feet shoulder-width apart. Hold the bar either to the 
                            front or back, depending on your preference. Toes should be turned out slightly. 
                            Start to lower.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            At the lowest point, thighs are slightly below parallel to the ground,
                            butt is slightly below the knees, head is neutral, looking 6-8 feet away,
                            spine is neutral and long—no tucking of the pelvis, the chest is up, shoulders are back
                        ,   and knees are in line with the toes.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="quad-exercise-2">
                    <h3>Walking Lunges</h3>
                    <p>
                        Walking lunges are the best for targeting the quadriceps. Plus, walking lunges are very functional, 
                        since you’re in continuous movement rather than remaining stationary.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
                    <ul class="quad-list">
                        <li>
                            While holding dumbbells in both hands at your sides, step forward with the right foot.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Both knees should drive the lunge movement downward, and aim to get both knees in a 90-degree angle. 
                            Don’t let the front knee drift past the toes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Stop before your lower knee hits the floor 
                            then drive through the legs to bring your rear 
                            leg back to the front leg, returning to stand.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Next, step forward with the left leg, repeating the pattern of movement. 
                            Continue alternating to hit your rep range.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="quad-exercise-1">
                    <h3>Hack Squat</h3>
                    <p>
                        The machine-based hack squat is great for the end of a workout when 
                        you are starting to get tired and need some extra support. You can also 
                        use hack squat to bridge squats and the leg press. You can also go a little 
                        heavier than you would with a free weight squat.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
                    <ul class="quad-list">
                        <li>
                            Your feet are at the middle platform, about shoulder width apart. Feet are flat.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Unhook the safety lever then lower yourself down. 
                            Stop when your thighs are just about parallel with the machine’s platform. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Next, power through your legs towards the starting position. Repeat.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="quad-exercise-2">
                    <h3>Leg Press</h3>
                    <p>
                        Put the leg press at the end of your workout to optimize the use of the muscle fibers in the quads.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
                    <ul class="quad-list">
                        <li>Sit in the leg press machine with the feet shoulder-width apart.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Keep the chest up, lower back long and pressed into the seat. 
                            Carefully release the safety and bend your knees to bring the weight close.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Don’t let your glutes off the chair. From there, 
                            push the sled away by powering through the legs. 
                            Don’t let your knees lock at the top. Slowly release back down to the starting position.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
